***Operating instructions***
When we access the home of our site, the site presents the local time. After this we can see each hour where we can write our task for that time, to save the user having to click on the blue button. If the user wants to delete the reminder he can press the red button.
The current time highlights the hour. Gray for past hours, red for current hour, green for future hour.
